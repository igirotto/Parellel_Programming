#Assignment 1

This analysis aims to implement an algorithm that computes the approximation of $\pi$ in both a serial and parallel manner. 
Moreover the scalability is computed for an increasing number of threads. 
Secondly, a visualization of the loop scheduling types for a toy code is made and the result is discussed.
